# HPC Data

This folder contains very large data files and results from high performance computing analyses. 

To setup first download `msdata` and `trinity` data folders by running this command from within this folder

```bash
	wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/1uz21zdqyyr61nt/msdata.zip?dl=0
	unzip msdata.zip

	wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/uhihvpe8puwebkq/trinity.zip?dl=0
	unzip trinity.zip
```

This should result in two folders `msdata` and `trinity` being present in this directory.  You should not need to modify files in these directories but you will need them to run other nalyses
