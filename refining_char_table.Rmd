## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data_wrangling}

library(tidyverse)

novel_seq_chars_full <- read_excel("novel_seq_chars_full.xls")

signals_only <- filter(novel_seq_chars_full, signalp == "Y")

high_cysteine_and_signals <- filter(signals_only, num_cysteines > 6)

#write table to file

write_delim(high_cysteine_and_signals,"real_novel_proteins_char.tsv",delim = "\t")


```

```{r now_for_known}

#insert xls file
known_signals_chars <- readxl::read_xls("hpc/signalp-4.1/known_seq_chars.xls",col_names = FALSE)

#name columns
names(known_signals_chars) <- c("ID","num_cysteines","seqlen","signalp")

#filter to have positive signal peptides only
known_signals <- filter(known_signals_chars, signalp == "Y") #1031

#filter to have high cysteines 
known_signals_high_c <- filter(known_signals, num_cysteines > 6) #463

known_short_seq <- filter(known_signals_high_c, seqlen <150) #112


```
