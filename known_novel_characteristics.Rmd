This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
sequence_data <- readxl::read_xls("hpc/blastp_db_searches/",col_names = FALSE)
names(sequence_data) <- c("ID","signalp","num_cysteines","seqlen","cysteine_percentage")


novel_char <- read_delim("hpc/blastp_db_searches/npcc.txt",delim = "\t",col_names = FALSE)

names(novel_char) <- c("ID","signalp","num_cysteines","seqlen","cysteine_percentage")

#removing a column
novel_char[2] <- NULL

# OR when you know the column name
novel_char <- subset( novel_char, select = -cysteine_percentage)

novel_char$db <- c ("novel")


known_char <- readxl::read_xls("hpc/signalp-4.1/known_name_len_c.xls", col_names = FALSE)

names(known_char) <- c("ID","num_cysteines","seqlen")

#adding a column called db with "known" as value and cysteine percentage

known_char$db <- c ("known")

known_char$cysteine_per_length <- (known_char$num_cysteines / known_char$seqlen)

novel_char$cysteine_per_length <- (novel_char$num_cysteines / novel_char$seqlen)


#binding the novel and known characteristic tables together 

known_novel_chars <- rbind(known_char, novel_char) 






```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

#histogram of known and novel characteristics showing sequence length

ggplot(data=known_novel_chars, aes(x=seqlen)) + geom_density(aes(color=db)) + xlim(0,200)

#histogram of known and novel characteristics showing cysteine percentage (number of cysteine/length)

ggplot(data=known_novel_chars, aes(x=num_cysteines/seqlen)) + geom_density(aes(color=db)) + xlim(0,0.10)

ggplot(data=known_novel_chars, aes(x=cysteine_per_length)) + geom_density(aes(color=db)) + xlim(0,0.7)



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
