## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data_wrangling}

library(tidyverse)

novel_seq_chars_full <- read_excel("novel_seq_chars_full.xls")

signals_only <- filter(novel_seq_chars_full, signalp == "Y")

high_cysteine_and_signals <- filter(signals_only, num_cysteines > 6)

#write table to file

write_delim(high_cysteine_and_signals,"real_novel_proteins_char.tsv",delim = "\t")


```
